# VideoSetupNX

An app for creating HTML files (using https://gbatemp.net/threads/html-video-template-nx.520956/) and converting files to switch compatible formats. (Warning: hacky and possibly shitty code here!)

__Features__
- Generates customized HTML from a folder of switch-compatible video files
- Converts video files to Switch-compatible format with optional resizing. (requires ffmpeg pre-installed)
- Burns in subtitles so you can watch your favorite anime anywhere!
- Autocreates episode preview snapshots
- Automatically sets up directories, HTML/CSS/JS files. Just drop your videos into the vids folder!

__Issues__
- None I'm aware of!

__Usage__

Follow each step, then hit "Generate project". It'll open the output directory when it's complete. Copy the videos you selected in Step 2 into the "vids" folder, then build the entire output folder (the stuff in the folder, not the folder itself!) with the Homebrew Web Framework.
